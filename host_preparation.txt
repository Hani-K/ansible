# To prepare a managed node for ansible, make sure the follow things are in place
# this whole process can also be automated using a bash script	

# on the managed node
1. create an ansible user
2. add the ansible user to sudo/wheel group
3. make sure python is installed (python 3.11 or newer)
4. make sure the ip of the machine is static (DHCP lease or nmtui)

# on the control node
1. create an ssh key (or use an avilable one).
2. send the ssh public key to the managed node (ssh-copy-id)
3. add the ip of the managed node in the inventory file.
